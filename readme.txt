first of all you need to install nodejs verion ( v16.17.1 ).
create new schema name "loginsystem" in sql work bench and import the tables from the database directory.
open terminal and run this command in the project directory "npm install".
go to the server directory and run this command again "npm install".
now you can run this command "npm start" in the project directory to run your react app.
